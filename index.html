<p>OAuth is really cool. Not exactly a groundbreaking statement, but there are many things I have come to appreciate even more now that I have a deeper sense of how they work. When I was first truly putting it to the test in my first project, Identity Crisis, I had a hard time grasping the difference between as merely authorizing a user and the necessity, should your needs require it, to create a mechanism to also have users on your site as well.</p>

<p>OAuth is merely a means to reliably verify someone’s identity on an external service. That’s it. What it’s not is a total solution to facilitate users on you app and manage permissions and control passwords and handle tables and reset forgotten usernames because you don’t need to worry about it because Twitter has it taken care of and everything is easy peazy breazy because OAuth has got it under control. Aha. It is not.</p>

<p>If you want to leverage an external service to interface with a function you are building yourself, OAuth is a great start. But you’ll still need to handle all your users yourself, and simply tack that extra token on should you choose to use it for anything else.It is one less thing you have to do in managing user authentication, but there are still a dozen things left to do before you’re done. The Devise gem is a great way to assist in the complexities of securely managing these relationships beyond OAuth.</p>

<p>Alas, nothing is very easy. Twitter was a relatively straightforward example, but the road was a bit bumpier when we tried to kick it into high gear with Uber (double pun intended).</p>

<p>(•_•)</p>

<p>( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■</p>

<p>(⌐■_■)</p>

<p>Knowing we wanted to build something socially powerful enough to move humans around together, Uber was an easy choice when it came to transportation providers. Their service is reliable, the API is robust, the cars were speedy and everything looked like sunny blue sky were ahead. To be clear, OAuth is not an API. OAuth (Open Authorization) has become an extremely common way to access walled APIs, but should not be referred to as an API itself. Basic terminology.</p>

<p>After dipping our toes in the RESTful waters we dove into the deep end to try to finagle Uber to serve us up a fresh token for my user account. It felt a little bit like we were going down a dark tunnel with no flashlight, so I relied on the Mac app Paw to familiarize myself with the raw traffic we were sending. It was also really helpful since it parsed JSON all in one swoop. We ended up using the OmniAuth gem, which includes basic OAuth strategies all under one roof. Once we finally landed on the correct params to send over (all over HTTPS, of course, because you already knew that you have to force Heroku to interact securely and not spend an hour panicking that the whole service strategy has to be scrapped), we got our token through redirect and stashed it aside for safekeeping. Yep, that’s right. We just used that as a means to log into our app. This way we never ask for a password! Uber can handle that drama. Thanks Uber.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://cl.ly/image/3L1S2B1i122H/Image%202014-12-09%20at%209.40.11%20AM.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p> So now that we know WHO they are through a means of a token, and we know WHAT they are since we have them as a user through Devise, we can make snazzy requests on their behalf. Whoop whoop. Because they granted us permission through OAuth, we have some capability to act on their behalf and can perform actions that Uber has scoped us with the appropriate permission to do so. More on those difficulties in round 2.</p>

				MVC Is the MVP</a>

	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3LntWLt.gif" alt="Jake" /></p>

<p> We were originally introduced to the Model, View and Controller concept, or MVC, 2 weeks ago when we started SQL and Active Record. Knowledge often flies very fast here and it can be difficult to ascertain what we’ll definitely need to grasp and other ideas that we may be able to lookup and reference later. When MVC stuck around in Rails I knew it was something worth spending the time to get to know. When I knew I needed to tweak something but didn’t know exactly where to do it, I would furiously toggle between all three and try to play a guessing game. Highly ineffective.</p>

<p>The idea of this three pronged approach is not specific to the things we’ve learned so far. Hardly! It’s a basic architecture for processing and delivering information to users, something nearly every program is responsible for. Our instructor, Avi, gave the example of a restaurant business where the model is the chef and the controller is the waiter, delivering the food. I obsessed with this example for so long and stretched it to its limit (and far beyond,) so I tried to take it from scratch and dig even deeper.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/rails/mvc-rails.png" alt="Diagram" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the model. It’s probably where you’ll be spending most of your time, anyway. Models are Ruby classes, and the most logic is going to be in here — more than the other two. They do the heavy lifting and the true processing portion. You want to avoid delegating these out later to something in the controller (that’s what the very concept of MVC is designed to prevent in my opinion). By creating it as independent of the controller as possible, you can have multiple controllers to process as needed. This is also the best place to validate your data as well.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>Controller</h3>
<p>Next up is controllers. I saw someone describe this as “Dilbert-esque”, and that’s pretty spot on. You remember Dilbert, right? His tie never seemed to stay down against his shirt, probably could’ve used a tie clip. But that’s not really what tie clips are for anymore, I think they’ve turned more into a fashion statement at this point. Besides, why does his tie even curve up?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://queens.db.toronto.edu/~cmishra/dilbert.gif" alt="Dilbert" /></p>

<p>Anyways, back to the controller. It barks simplistic orders and dictates a lot of the basics of how the program works. Connecting the model to the view, it knows how to do something - but should only know how to do it just well enough to do it correctly. Forcing too much logic in your controller and taking the heavy lifting out of the model is detrimental to your overall program as it is the least abstract way to go about it. A proper controller will never include any database related actions, this needs to be in the model.
<br />
<br /></p>
<h3>View</h3>

<p>Finally, the view is what the user ends up seeing. Using ERB (embedded Ruby), the goal should be to make this as lightweight of a file as possible. You can use HTML and Ruby to render a fantastic output fit for a king! There’s not a whole lot to say about the viewers, but these must be kept simple.</p>

<p>Another diagram I liked a lot was this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/MVC-Process.svg" alt="Dia2" /></p>

<p>There’s no one right way to draw the diagram, but there are many wrong ways to draw it. None of these are it. With the appropriate planning, you’ll have a powerful MVC trio in no time!</p>

				Packages on Packages on Packages</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>Inspired by <a href="http://tomcohenno.github.io/blog/2014/10/20/rrrrrrrspec/">Tom’s RubyTest package add on post</a>, I went on a hunt to find other cool additions that might make our day to day tasks even easier. I did not return from the hunt empty handed! Here are four that particularly stood out to me:</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/3o362H3s1d3h/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.43.35%20AM.png" alt="Meme" /></p>

<h2>Git Package</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git/wiki">Git Install Details</a></p>

<p>Github is the backbone behind collaborative software development, making this service a fairly language agnostic tool relevant to everyone. The aptly named package “Git” for Sublime ties in core functions directly within the text editor. Even though I haven’t reached the point where I’m cloning other people’s code outside the school to work on, it still includes basic functions that allow you to bypass terminal and work directly inside Sublime.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/2B0M1Z332h3h/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.44.27%20AM.png" alt="List" /></p>

<p>An especially useful option is Quick Commit, which simultaneously stages your commit as well. Note that you can type in your commit message in a special dialog option that appears. Current Git branch status is displayed at the bottom of the status bar at all times. Finally, you can push as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/1O1I2f0I1A2S/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.45.24%20AM.png" alt="GitMessage" /></p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/320c3v0N2L2x/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.45.46%20AM.png" alt="GitStatus" /></p>

<h2>SublimeLinter Package:</h2>
<p><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeLinter">SublimeLinter Package Details</a></p>

<p>For those who may be syntax challenged, two Packages stood out as particularly useful. SublimeLinter and SublimeCodeIntel have both proved useful and timesaving additions to my Package library.</p>

<p>Linting, as described by Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>In computer programming, lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code. The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. The term lint-like behavior is sometimes applied to the process of flagging suspicious language usage. Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of source code.</p></blockquote>
<p>As all of my past tablemates can attest to, I became wildly skilled at failing to end my method definitions. Of course, this would cause the entire program to produce an error. Linting packages for Sublime (there are many) take a language-specific Linter and referbce those while checking your code for potential errors in real time. Like everything in Sublime, options to customize are abound.</p>

<p>Because the default evaluates code in realtime as you type (similar to spellcheck), experienced users may find this especially distracting as there will always be errors before you finish your line. You can change to have it delay to avoid this. SublimeLinter shows both warnings and errors, shown respectively below.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/3m3D1j3y1O11/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.46.12%20AM.png" alt="LintDwarves" /></p>
<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/461H2T0e1X0G/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.47.38%20AM.png" alt="LintLast" /></p>

<h2>SublimeCodeIntel Package:</h2>
<p><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeCodeIntel">SublimeCodeIntel Package Details</a></p>

<p>On our first day we installed Ruby specific add ons, which generally autocomplete Ruby syntax particularly well. Another is CodeIntel, which I have come to prefer as it saves time by offering cookie cutter methods with autocomplete.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/1n3K34383M1w/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.46.32%20AM.png" alt="Intel1" /></p>
<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/1z2Q0j0E3I1g/Image%202014-10-23%20at%209.46.55%20AM.png" alt="Intel2" /></p>

<h2>Terminal Package:</h2>
<p><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Terminal">Terminal Package Details</a></p>

<p>Finally, Terminal by Will Bond (the same person who made the famous Package Control) is a super simple option to open the current Sublime file in Terminal, auto navigating to the appropriate directory with a cd command in the background.</p>

<p>All of these are compatible with both Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3 and can be installed with Package Control.</p>

		<p>APIs, or Application programming interfaces, are an incredibly useful component in software development that allow developers to build things that speak to other programs. The first time I was introduced to APIs was when Steve Jobs announced the addition of apps to the iOS ecosystem. At the time, believe it or not, iPhones did not have an App Store and developers were eager to build but unable to ship. in iOS 2 Apple permitted access to an extremely limited set of capabilities and were very strict in App review and approval, as the first apps often tried to utilize private APIs.</p>

<p><img src="http://gdeluxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IOS-HISTORY.jpg" alt="iOS API" /></p>

<p>In Ruby, the implications are equally empowering. Users often have the expectation that things “just work” with each other, and APIs allow developers to make that happen. From a developer’s point of view, offering an API that is both clearly documented and easy to implement will encourage other developers to “speak” to your program and leverage core functionalities. APIs are absolutely essential and it wouldn’t be unreasonable to consider them the very backbone of the ‘Internet of Things’. From music services to fitness devices to social networkings sites, APIs power the internet and fulfill the never ending expectation of high performing tools.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3O1W1p3g3E3n2O1W1407/Image%202014-10-09%20at%209.50.08%20AM.png" alt="Spotify" /></p>

<p>When developers choose not to create these pathways for communication with their tools, they are called undocumented or private APIs. Although they may work on a temporary basis, because these use things that may be phased out in the future they are vulnerable to break at any point in time.</p>

<p>No matter the language or platform, APIs will continue to propel the internet we use today to new heights and functionality!</p>
